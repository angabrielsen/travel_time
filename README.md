# travel_time

This is a test I completed as part of a job application. The coded needed to satisy the following:

Computes the average travel time (as a decimal number of seconds) from some point a (where start_sensors are located) to point b (where end_sensors are located) for a given range of time (start_time to end_time), for example from 6 AM to 7 AM. You should use the last time a device was seen at the start beacons and the first time they were seen at the end beacons
