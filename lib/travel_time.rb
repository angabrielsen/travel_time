class TravelTime

  # computes the average travel time (as a decimal number of seconds) from some point a (where start_sensors are located) to point b (where end_sensors are located)
  # for a given range of time (start_time to end_time) for example from 6 AM to 7 AM
  # you should use the last time a device was seen at the start beacons and the first time they were seen at the end beacons

  # Note: You can get the fractional seconds from a DateTime using to_f (definition in date_time.rb)
